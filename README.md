## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+** (recommended: Python 3.11)
- **Git** for cloning the repository
- **Schmick Club credentials** (username and password)

### 1. Clone and Setup Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aidev1008/service.git
cd service

# Create Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate

# Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Playwright Firefox browser (required for Schmick Club)
playwright install firefox
```

### 2. Create Required Environment File

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** You must create a `.env` file with your credentials:

```bash
# Create .env file in the project root
touch .env

# Add the following content to .env (replace with your actual credentials):
SCHMICK_USER=your_schmick_username
SCHMICK_PASS=your_schmick_password
ENVIRONMENT=development
PORT=8000
HEADLESS=true
```

**Example `.env` file:**
```bash
SCHMICK_USER=your_email@example.com
SCHMICK_PASS=your_secure_password
ENVIRONMENT=development
PORT=8000
HEADLESS=true
```

### 3. Create Required Directories

```bash
# Create necessary directories that are ignored by git
mkdir -p logs
mkdir -p screenshots
mkdir -p browser-cache
mkdir -p .playwright

# Create empty state files
touch state.json
touch extracted_id.txt
```

### 4. Start the Service

```bash
# Option 1: Using the start script
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh

# Option 2: Direct uvicorn command
uvicorn app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Option 3: Using Python directly
python start_server.py
```

### 5. Verify Installation

```bash
# Test the health endpoint

## üîß Development and Debugging

### Debugging Mode

Run with visible browser for debugging:
```bash
# Set in .env file
HEADLESS=false

# Or run with environment variable
HEADLESS=false uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Install test dependencies (if not already installed)
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio httpx

# Run specific test files
python simple_test.py
python tests/test_service.py

# Run all tests in tests directory
pytest tests/ -v

# Test the unified flow manually
python unified_flow.py
```

### Testing the Automation Flow Locally

**üéØ Direct Flow Testing (Recommended for Development)**

Test the complete Schmick Club automation flow without the API server:

```bash
# Method 1: Run the unified flow directly
python unified_flow.py

# Method 2: Test with visible browser (for debugging)
HEADLESS=false python unified_flow.py

# Method 3: Test specific scenarios
python simple_test.py
```

The `unified_flow.py` script will:
1. üîê Log into Schmick Club using your `.env` credentials
2. üìù Fill out the membership form with test data
3. ‚úÖ Submit the form and extract the membership ID
4. üìä Generate comprehensive logs for analysis

**Sample Output:**
```
üöÄ Starting Schmick Club membership automation...
   üìù Request logged with ID: req_1a2b3c4d
   üåê Navigating to: https://app.schmickclub.com/memberships/distributors
   üîê Attempting login...
   ‚úÖ Login successful
   üìù Filling membership form...
   ‚úÖ Form submitted successfully
   üÜî Extracted ID: 15
   ‚úÖ Automation completed successfully
```

**üñ•Ô∏è API Server Testing**

Test through the FastAPI server (useful for integration testing):

```bash
# Start the server first
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000

# In another terminal, test the API
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/

# Test with minimal required fields
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/submit-membership \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "businessName": "Test Business",
    "abn": "12345678901",
    "businessAddress": "123 Test St, Sydney NSW 2000",
    "postalAddress": "123 Test St, Sydney NSW 2000", 
    "businessPhone": "0412345678",
    "businessEmail": "test@test.com",
    "businessType": "Sole Trader",
    "contactPerson": "Test User",
    "contactPhone": "0412345678",
    "contactEmail": "test@test.com",
    "startDate": "2024-02-01",
    "terms": true
  }'

# Test Railway deployment (if deployed)
./test_railway_curl.sh
```

**üìä Advanced Testing Options**

```bash
# Test with comprehensive data
python tests/test_service.py

# Test different business types
python tests/workflow_test.py

# Debug form filling issues
HEADLESS=false python tests/robust_test.py

# Quick validation test
python tests/quick_test.py
```

**üéØ Customizing Test Data**

The `unified_flow.py` script uses built-in test data. To customize it, edit the script or create your own test file:

```python
# Example: Create custom_test.py
import asyncio
from unified_flow import process_membership

# Your custom test data
test_data = {
    "businessName": "Your Test Business",
    "abn": "12345678901",
    "businessAddress": "Your Test Address",
    "postalAddress": "Your Test Postal Address", 
    "businessPhone": "0412345678",
    "businessEmail": "your-test@email.com",
    "businessType": "Company",  # Options: Sole Trader, Company, Partnership
    "contactPerson": "Your Name",
    "contactPhone": "0412345678", 
    "contactEmail": "your-test@email.com",
    "startDate": "2024-02-01",
    "terms": True
}

# Run the automation
result = asyncio.run(process_membership(test_data))
print(f"Result: {result}")
```

**üîç Testing Different Scenarios**

```bash
# Test with invalid data (to see validation errors)
python tests/test_validation_errors.py

# Test with different business types
# Edit unified_flow.py and change businessType to:
# - "Sole Trader"
# - "Company" 
# - "Partnership"
# - "Trust"

# Test with minimal vs complete data
python tests/minimal_data_test.py
python tests/complete_data_test.py
```

### Log Analysis and Monitoring

Monitor logs in real-time during testing:
```bash
# Watch request logs (created by unified_flow.py)
tail -f requests.log

# Watch validation errors with user context
tail -f validation_errors.log

# Watch main application log (FastAPI server)
tail -f logs/schmick_service.log

# Watch all logs simultaneously
tail -f requests.log validation_errors.log logs/*.log
```

**Understanding Log Output:**

When you run `python unified_flow.py`, you'll see logs created in:
- `requests.log` - Every automation request with user data
- `validation_errors.log` - Form validation issues with full context
- Console output - Real-time progress and results

**Sample Log Entries:**
```bash
# requests.log
[2024-01-15T10:30:00] REQUEST_ID: req_1a2b3c4d
USER DATA: {
  "businessName": "Test Business Ltd",
  "abn": "12345678901",
  ...
}

# Console output during unified_flow.py execution
üöÄ Starting Schmick Club membership automation...
   üìù Request logged with ID: req_1a2b3c4d
   üîê Attempting login...
   ‚úÖ Login successful
   üìù Filling membership form...
   ‚úÖ Form submitted successfully
   üÜî Extracted ID: 15
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Deployment

### Railway.app Deployment

The service is configured for Railway cloud deployment:

```bash
# Deploy to Railway (requires Railway CLI)
railway login
railway link
railway up

# Test Railway deployment
./test_railway_curl.sh
```

**Railway Environment Variables:**
Set these in your Railway dashboard:
- `SCHMICK_USER` - Your Schmick Club username
- `SCHMICK_PASS` - Your Schmick Club password  
- `ENVIRONMENT` - Set to `production`
- `HEADLESS` - Set to `true`

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t schmick-service .

# Run container
docker run -d \
  --name schmick-service \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -e SCHMICK_USER=your-username \
  -e SCHMICK_PASS=your-password \
  -e HEADLESS=true \
  -v $(pwd)/logs:/app/logs \
  schmick-service
```

### Docker Compose

Create `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  schmick-service:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - SCHMICK_USER=${SCHMICK_USER}
      - SCHMICK_PASS=${SCHMICK_PASS}
      - HEADLESS=true
      - ENVIRONMENT=production
    volumes:
      - ./logs:/app/logs
      - ./data:/app/data
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Run with:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Important Notes for Cloud Deployment

‚ö†Ô∏è **Geo-blocking Consideration**: Schmick Club may have geo-blocking that prevents access from non-Australian IP addresses. If you encounter issues with cloud deployments, consider using an Australian-based hosting provider.

## Customization

### Updating Selectors

The service uses CSS/XPath selectors defined in `selectors.py`. Update these to match the actual Schmick website:

```python
# In selectors.py - update these placeholders
selectors = {
    "login": {
        "url": "https://actual-schmick-url.com/login",
        "username": "input[name='actual-username-field']",
        "password": "input[name='actual-password-field']",
        # ... more selectors
    }
}
```

### Adding Custom Fields

1. Add field to `MembershipRecord` model in `app.py`
2. Add selector to `selectors.py` 
3. Add field mapping in `FIELD_MAPPING`

### Error Handling

The service provides detailed error messages for common issues:
- **Login failures**: Check credentials and site availability
- **CAPTCHA detected**: Manual intervention required
- **Selector not found**: Website structure may have changed
- **Timeout errors**: Increase `TIMEOUT_MS` or check network

## Monitoring

### Structured Logging

All operations are logged in JSON format:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "level": "INFO", 
  "event": "form_fill",
  "message": "Filled firstName field",
  "request_id": "uuid-here",
  "salesforce_id": "SF123456"
}
```

### Health Monitoring

Monitor the `/health` endpoint and check for:
- Browser process health
- Storage state validity
- Environment configuration

### Performance Metrics

Key metrics to monitor:
- Request processing time
- Success/failure rates
- Concurrent request count
- Browser memory usage

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Setup Issues

1. **Missing `.env` file**
   ```bash
   # Error: "SCHMICK_USER environment variable not set"
   # Solution: Create .env file with your credentials
   touch .env
   echo "SCHMICK_USER=your_username" >> .env
   echo "SCHMICK_PASS=your_password" >> .env
   ```

2. **Missing directories**
   ```bash
   # Error: "Permission denied" or "Directory not found"
   # Solution: Create required directories
   mkdir -p logs screenshots browser-cache .playwright
   ```

3. **Playwright browser not installed**
   ```bash
   # Error: "firefox not found"
   # Solution: Install Firefox browser
   playwright install firefox
   ```

### Unified Flow Testing Issues

1. **unified_flow.py fails to start**
   ```bash
   # Error: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'playwright'"
   # Solution: Ensure virtual environment is activated and dependencies installed
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Error: "SCHMICK_USER not found"
   # Solution: Check .env file exists and has correct format
   cat .env
   ```

2. **Browser automation issues**
   ```bash
   # Error: "Login failed" or "Timeout"
   # Solution: Run with visible browser to debug
   HEADLESS=false python unified_flow.py
   
   # Check if credentials are correct
   # Verify Schmick Club site is accessible manually
   ```

3. **Form filling failures**
   ```bash
   # Error: "Selector not found" or "Element not found"
   # Solution: Website structure may have changed
   # Run with visible browser and check the form
   HEADLESS=false python unified_flow.py
   
   # Check validation_errors.log for specific field issues
   tail validation_errors.log
   ```

4. **No output or logs**
   ```bash
   # Issue: Script runs but no visible results
   # Solution: Check console output and log files
   python unified_flow.py > test_output.log 2>&1
   cat test_output.log
   
   # Check if log files are created
   ls -la *.log
   ```

### Runtime Issues

1. **Login failures**
   - Verify credentials in `.env` file
   - Check if Schmick Club site is accessible
   - Delete `state.json` to force fresh login
   - Run with `HEADLESS=false` to see what's happening

2. **Form submission errors**
   - Check `logs/validation_errors.log` for detailed error context
   - Verify all required fields are provided
   - Ensure field values meet Schmick Club requirements

3. **Selector not found errors**
   - Website structure may have changed
   - Update selectors in `website_selectors.py`
   - Run in headful mode (`HEADLESS=false`) to debug

4. **Timeout errors**
   - Increase `TIMEOUT_MS` in `.env`
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify Schmick Club site is responsive

### Debug Steps

1. **Enable visible browser**: Set `HEADLESS=false` in `.env`
2. **Check logs**: Monitor `logs/` directory for detailed error information
3. **Test manually**: Navigate to Schmick Club site manually first
4. **Clear cache**: Delete `state.json`, `extracted_id.txt` and restart
5. **Verify selectors**: Use browser developer tools to check HTML elements

### Log Analysis

```bash
# Check recent errors
tail -20 logs/validation_errors.log

# Monitor real-time activity  
tail -f logs/schmick_service.log

# Search for specific errors
grep "ERROR" logs/*.log
```
